# Buildpack V3

This build template builds source into a container image using [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io).

The Cloud Native Buildpacks website describes v3 buildpacks as:

> ... pluggable, modular tools that translate source code into container-ready artifacts
> such as OCI images. They replace Dockerfiles in the app development lifecycle with a higher level
> of abstraction. ...  Cloud Native Buildpacks embrace modern container standards, such as the OCI
> image format. They take advantage of the latest capabilities of these standards, such as remote
> image layer rebasing on Docker API v2 registries.

**Note**: The current Cloud Foundry buildpacks are available in the [CF template](README-CF.md).

## Create the template

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knative/build-templates/master/buildpacks/cnb.yaml
```

## Parameters

* **IMAGE:** The image you wish to create. For example, "repo/example", or "example.com/repo/image". (_required_)
* **RUN_IMAGE:** The run image buildpacks will use as the base for IMAGE. (_default:_ `packs/run:v3alpha2`)
* **BUILDER_IMAGE** The image on which builds will run. ( default: `packs/samples:v3alpha2`)
* **USE_CRED_HELPERS:** Use Docker credential helpers. Set to `"true"` or `"false"` as string values. (_default:_ `"true"`)
* **CACHE** The name of the persistent app cache volume (_default:_ an empty directory -- effectively no cache)
* **USER_ID** The user ID of the builder image user (_default:_ 1000)
* **GROUP_ID** The group ID of the builder image user (_default:_ 1000)
